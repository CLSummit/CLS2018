Unconference discussion:
**Being a Good Ally.  Or...so, you’re a white guy that wants to help.**
_Led and facilitated by: Jaice Singer DuMars.
Notetaker: Swarna Podila._

Consider diversity as a critical factor in open source communities.  Being empathetic to others’ experiences, perspectives, and backgrounds and being compassionate to others is important.

It is not just white men that feel like they’re in a tricky situation; there are others that feel like an imposter.

Servant leadership 

People’s needs and voices must be included while drafting code of conduct and community guidelines. 

Watch out for “white saviour” behavior.
Watch out for “predatory allyship” and encourage safe reporting.

Understand motivations:
- As an ally (white male, for example), what are your motivations?  Are you genuinely trying to help?  Or are you presenting a “white saviour” behavior?  Am I helping?
- Do not pretend to be an ally.
- Look for warning signs.  And bring it up with the oppressed and the perpetrator, if necessary.  Always check with the victim before intervening; you may run the risk of putting the victim under the spotlight without their choice.

Distinguish and get clarity on the motivations that drive allies.
As an ally, state your intentions clearly.  Be transparent.  Build a trust-filled relationship.  Be self-aware of how you want to help and how you can help.

Plant called Toxic Mimics (sp?).  Two things that look similar with opportunistic and detrimental behavior.  Toxic mimic presents itself as a regular plant and you become ill when you eat it.  Similarly, look out for toxic mimics in your community or organization.

How do you balance victim’s feelings/reaction vs. keeping the community in good health?  Anonymous reporting is very useful.  Anonymous reporting is a double edged sword -- how do you investigate the report that is anonymous and at the same time, how do you ensure the incident doesn’t repeat?

Is allyship the same as mentoring?  Is allyship the same as enforcing code of conduct?
- Folks that need allies might not need mentors.  An ally can become a mentor (it does not have to be a mutually exclusive relationship).
- As an ally, you have the responsibility of sharing the burden/load of the oppressed and speaking up for them.
- There’s also a risk of putting the oppressed under a spotlight -- so when you’re an ally, beware of HOW you help them.
- As an ally, think about HOW you can help them or help the situation rather than trying to present yourself as an ally.

Demonstrate awareness and let the oppressed know you’re there to help, if needed. 
Provide support - either behind or at the scene, to remediate the situation.  

Victims are always afraid of the consequences of taking steps to remediate the incident.  Victims are also worried about not wanting to present themselves as a victim.

Resort of justice - as an ally, you can use this for minor or major things to arrive at a resolution.
