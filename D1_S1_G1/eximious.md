Handling Big Changes, lead by Deb Nicholson

Notes

    What are strategies for communicating and planning response to big changes in an org?

    Minimization?

    Ultimatum?

    Other things?

    Actively work with projects to document a plan

    To alleviate concerns

    Getting people to take a look at their own future with the change


    How do we get a voice? 

    "Calling in before calling out" as a strategy. Working informally to communicate ways to get in front of the change, propose some concrete action (such as meetings) to help either prepare for the change or maybe avoid it altogether.

    Have public meetings to share viewpoints in both directions, and let people react to the proposed change. Work toward compromise based on what concerns people express.

    Work toward cross-department/team/group understanding. Be aware that some people or groups may be good at bringing people in early, but other people or groups (even with an organization) might not. 


Cross-team or cross-dept conversations before things go south
Have designated points of contacts or liasons to work across teams/depts
Pilot change before committing to new ways of doing things

How do you repair trust after a big change? 

    Designate a recurring given time for each team/group to talk about the change and how they're coping. Feedback not only among peers but up to decision makers too. Demonstrates responsiveness and listening, reacting to feedback to help people become more comfortable with the change.

    Remember to have low-stress activities, fun activities, etc., for "team building" ... but not until the listening has happened.

    offer people the opportunity to implement changes that they'd like to see 

    Someties we're talking to and listening to the same people all the time


What about when you're building a more inclusive community and people are unhappy with what you see as "good change?"
Honesty. 

Give people an opportunity to discuss big potential changes before they are implemented 

Who's driving the change? 
Who is a stakeholder? Who feels like they're a stakeholder? 

Buy-in is important. Consensus creates a more inclusive dynamic 

Longer-term goals -- that might not feel good in the short-term -- are some of the hardest things to get buy-in around

Are there any recognizable milestones for dealing with change? 
Maybe you make your own. 

Any kind of change can be a kind of "mini-grief" 

Tying change to a high-profile objective

Community post-mortems, do surveys, being humble to your community and ask how you can improve

Sometimes people just need to be heard. 

Real-time communication helps you find the potholes

Talking to your biggest supporters and your detractors 

Find someone who is good (patient) to hear from detractors. 

Transparency around dates and expectations is really key.
Keep people updated during a lengthy change process

Takeaways?

    No silver bullet, it will take work

    The earlier you bring people in, the better

    Document a plan to take control of your voice (and the voices of others) post-change

    Be humble to your community and ask how you can improve

    Sometimes people just need to be heard. 

    Talk to key stakeholders or people who are likely to have strong opinions, ahead of time. 1-on-1 conversations may yield more than public dialogue.
