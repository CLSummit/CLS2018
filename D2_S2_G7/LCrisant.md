"Open Source Educational Outreach and Student Engagement"  

Session Leader Background  
Remy DeCausemaker - Manager, Twitter's Open Source Program  
@remy_d  
Remy has been involved in "Hackademia" for a while.  Developed first academic minor in OSS at Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT).  Now helping develop academic OSS outreach programs at Twitter.  

RIT Academic Programs  
Story of OSS academic minor began with an offer for free Excel computers posted on Fedora mailing list.  Professor of game design course at RIT agreed use the Excel laptops offered on Fedora in/for his course.  Through that course began working with upstream OSS orgs.   

PANTS projects:  Students shipped 3 PRs now in production  

Became a research program as well as minor.  

Other relevant programs/organizations:  
POSSE - Professor Open Source Summer Experience  
Teachingopensource.org  
Student Engagement Programs  
Google Summer of Code - Program has been around for 10-15 years.  It's a 15-week-long remote paid internship.  

Twitter is cooperating with University of San Francisco Computer Science Dept.  

Student work on capstone projects.  There are mid-term and final check ins.  

Value prop = Can evaluate and train students while seeing whether they would be someone suitable for hiring  

OSS is unifying element for capstone projects.  Based pitches on existing models (OUTREACHY and GSOC).  Also leveraging templates and other program elements from those organizations.  

Advanced projects course - do one thing and do it well.  First design, then code, then document and release.  

The following are all comments from various session participants:  

Re:  experience with Google Summer of Code (GSOC)  
It's always centered around a project.  Totally clashed with everything I'd been doing up until that point.  Not as good for integrating you into the community or giving you freedom to help people.  Feels more like turning in a homework assignment.  

Re:  OSS EDU outreach activities  
Find I'm often explaining OSS and free software to young people.  That's generally not too exciting to them but their eyes light up at mention of animae.  Learned that it's useful to have projects that are interesting to people who aren't professional software developers (i.e. students)    

+1 on comment above.   Involved with a pilot program with Girl Scouts that used image editing as hook to get girls interested. Programs tend to be more successful if you can meet people where they are.  

Re:  Facebook Internship Program  
Students do 6-week boot camp where you rotate among different teams and at end, you get to choose with whom you want to work.  

Re:  Project Types/Content  
At OSU we start with small tasks before moving to large tasks to expose people to a wide range of things before asking them to specialize.  Having broader experiences seems to work relatively well for students as opposed to asking them to specialize from the get-go.  

Re:  Working with EDU organizations  
Institutional perspective of accepting OSS as an important part of the curriculum is sorely lacking.  Traditionally, focus mainly on computer literacy.    Introducing OSS even from tools perspective is difficult.  An example of a project that's working well is one where we're refurbishing computers that have been decommissioned from school districts.  Includes adding OSS to re-built computers.  Pulls in K-12 component.  Have started pushing this program to colleges.  Teach is at weekend and summer camps.   Mentorship is a key part of community-building.  

Re: Openhatch campus outreach  
Challenge is getting schools involved.  May get lucky finding a champion at a school.  Would help if we could figure out how to get schools to come to us (but we'll need to foot the bill for that).  

Re:  Importance of Champions  
Faculty champions are the key to a project being successful or not. Helps with timing, expectation management, etc.  

Dynamics of professorship can make getting involved in higher ed relatively difficult, especially if/when trying to work with those who haven't gained tenure yet or who are involved in research.  Not incentive for professors and faculty to get involved.  

Academic publishing operates very differently from OSS.  For example, if many authors on a paper, the credit for each author is diluted by the number of total authors.  That's different from OSS collaborative models.  

Universities that appreciate /value experiential learning are likely more receptive to outreach than others.  

Instructors at community college more typically people that have worked in industry.    Wondering if outreach to community colleges might help find more immediate faculty champions.    

Code schools and meet-ups are also places where students learn.  They are also pulling in former faculty as teachers.  

Re:  Other/Misc  
Sponsorships can help foot bill for flying OSS project leaders to speak to groups of students, etc.  

Off-shoot of Wikipedia called Wiki Edu.  Works with professors to have output of students be Wiki articles rather than papers.
