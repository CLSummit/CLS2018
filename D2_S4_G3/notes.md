## Intro:
### What's the community I volunteer with?
The NFTy Magicians community is a blockchain-related community, focused on Non-Fungible Tokens (NFT). The founder started the community in April 2018 to get projects working with NFTs to connect, and to start discussing standards proposals for NFTs on the Ethereum blockchain.

### What have we done so far?
* Discord
* Discourse
* A  first proposed standard (ERC-998) & corresponding Github repo with a WIP implementation to allow for testing of ideas and discussions that are more than just theoretical.  
* The Github repo has 1  main contributor, 1 initial contributor, 1 early stage helper contributor.
* We have had 3 calls so far, spaced at 3 week intervals.  
* The founder writes amazing Medium blog posts, tweets.
* A few of us are spreading the word.

### Our concerns?
* How to get forks translated into pull requests?
* How to avoid potential users thinking your repo is something it isn't?
    
### What are other "newborn" community concerns?
1. Basic steps: format and awareness building; going beyond your usual community to recruit others. 
2. Define what community is. Goals, mission, value proposition... how to keep people coming back.
3. Regrets and mistakes to learn from. Working with other networks and communities to partner and support their work as well. 
4. How to communicate and what platform works best for our community.
5. Scaling and growing both projects and people contributing to community. 


### Does anyone who's been there have advice to offer?
1. Real-time works for some, but consistent record is needed for onboarding as well. Slack, Discord, etc.
2. Monthly check-ins to see how documentation is working for contributors, both in-house and public-facing docs. 
3. Documenting internal knowledge and actually maintaining it.
4. Meeting your community where they are. Language, focus, size. 
5. Rust community: Inclusive aspects, including  moderation built in from beginning. 
6. Trust vs Safety: Setting expectations, rules in communication channels. Creating safe spaces, places to address issues.
7. To be successful, assume success. 
8. Think about Codes of Conduct before an event/community meetings.
9. Finding strengths of community members. De-escalation, inclusion, communication qualities, intentional planning for leadership positions, giving people room to grow into positions.
10. CMX: professional community management forum has a how-to guide to get started in community management.
