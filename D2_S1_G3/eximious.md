Can't we all get along?  

(Originally said by Rodney King in the wake of the LA riots.)  

Conversations that devolve into potshots amongst people who disagree.   

Biases tend to get in the way of useful conversations  

Ignorance can shape your opinion, but can we get to a place where understand each other?  

How can we exchange ideas and walk away as friends?  

How do you deal with conflict when the person is attacking your right to life, liberty and happiness?  

We're not talking about normalizing "human trash"   

Trying to change an opinion vs. trying to understand their viewpoint  

How do we cause groups of people to coordinate despite their identity?   

50 people is the number you can work with regularly  

1000 is how many people you know  

Polity is "everybody who cares about the thing"  

Constituency is people who care about the same things or the thing in the same way  

Compromise is best when we understand what people want.   

People are not their opinions.  

"Friends of hunters who would rather not see animal heads in your feed" --the new slack channel  

Assume good faith -- that somebody is being upfront about their perspective.   
Violating fundamental human rights is not up for discussion   

"You have to pick a side"   

No ad hominem, when participating in conversation it's everyone's job to say "Hey, keep it classy" or "Don't go ad hominem"  

It's especially important for people to call in those they *agree* with when they are crossing that line.  

Assume that people are passionate for a reason. Try to find out more about their passion.  

Civil discourse, wading through the "bullshit"  

We've lost a lot of language around concession  

Opinion vs. fact, lots of conflating  

The dearth of true primary factual information, we don't have much access to empirical information  

Empirically show the impact, bringing them to an empirical truth  

The scientific method, encourages cynicism  

How do we do that? Show somebody something.   
 
Radical candor, be open. It's ok to try to change someone's viewpoint but recognize when things are getting heated and you may need to step back or bring in a moderator.   

One strategy that is useful, the use of intermediaries. So you can have a quiet conversation about the sticking points.  

Some tools, "Non Violent Communication" https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonviolent_Communication  

Avoiding logical fallacies is super-important.  

Know what a fact is, it can take a long time to get to a "fact"  
Important to do your research. Get context for your numbers and information.  
"Advertancy"  

Winning and losing, we know how to compete but we're not as good at collaborating.  
eg. If I'm not right then I'm wrong. (can be really difficult to move forward)  

Trust and power exchange

Could we as community managers be the intermediary?  
Or perhaps we should be encouraging everyone to be an intermediary  
and overseeing the network of intermediary  

"Help me understand you"  
Didn't always work because I was asking them to do the work  
Try to do a little research before you ask the other person to help you understand them  

"Take it off line"  
Get on the phone.   

In open source we're supposed to be transparent, so when we resolve offline bring back a summary  
We can give people a way to save face (or not air their dirty laundry)  

Reach out in private message early on

Facts fly out the window when people get really heated  
Decouple facts and analysis  
Publicly state that you might be wrong  

Declare bankruptcy, you know you're being manipulated but it happens anyway  
Get yourself to a place where you don't need to have the last word  

Power in discussion, empowering others give you the power  
Power doesn't have to be about crushing others  
It can be about mutually empowering and building each other up  

Emotions... it can be really hard to separate facts from emotions.  
Trying understand where they're coming from  

Facts are stupid and irrelevant  
If we're dehumanizing people, then we've lost.   

Social media is very unnatural.  
Start with civility, don't weaponize your facts  

We can't all agree on what is a fact.  
It's all radically contingent  

Be willing to have your mind changed  

"Takeaways"  

Emotions trump logic and social media is designed to keep us in that high emotional state  
"Put a pin in it"   

Can we all go and talk to people we disagree with and model that behavior?  
Let's start the mini-revolution. :)
