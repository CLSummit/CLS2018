## Discussion Notes

* What is a fiscal sponosor, generally?
  * 
 * What kind of services do they generally provide? (Or not?) Why?
  * Funding model for fiscal sponsors is very lean
  * Difficult for FS's to "bootstrap" consulting for early-phase preparation before a project/community is mature enough for the fiscal sponsor!
 * What are the other needs that projects have that FS can't/don't provide?
  * Healthcare and basic human services (benfits) for contributors/community members, that traditional employers might provide
   * Fiscal sponsors find this difficult because there isn't steady long-term funding for each project
   * The type of people that end up getting funded tend to be privileged people
 * Capacity building: helping to build org/people networks, helping to coordinate volunteers
 * Consensus building: Facilitating community issues, especially across cultures
		* Different needs/levels of specialization for small grassroots style orgs vs big orgs (like Mercy Corps)
		* Legal assitsance: Frameworks for DCO's, license help, have an "honest broker" especially when working with large orgs
		* Technology: Orgs like OSUOSL.org that can provide various types of IT infrastructure, DevOps-type support
		* Value in "investing" like Y-Combinator style in FLOSS projects?
		* 
	* Are there alternative types of organization that could provide those services?
		* Corporate sponsors for these activities?
		* Donations of "in kind" services? 
		* "Professional association" of FLOSS or other community builders?
		* "Matchmaking"
			* https://taprootfoundation.org/ - could a similar org exist for FLOSS? could it integrate a paid consulting service for sustainability?
			* https://opensource.net/ - potential place to build a community of practice/knowledge
		* Oregon Bar Association: Legal services at low cost -- maybe an opportunity to leverage? Or a model to adapt?
