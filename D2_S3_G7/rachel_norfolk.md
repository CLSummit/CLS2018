Managing Conflict / Negotiating Power Dynamics
=====================================

Combined session: George DeMet ( @gdemet ) & Lus ( @

George: Drupal agency owner & Chair of the Community Working Group for the Drupal Project. 

If issues left unchecked, leads to loss of productivity

1 out of every 5 people who witnessed negative behaviour, left the project

Underrepresented groups far more likely to experience negative behaviour

Lus: There are explicit things we can recognise as harassment. But what other things? How do we go about trusting others?

”the next stage of belonging” - how do we facilitate this?

People feel reluctant to call-out those seen as leaders.

—

How have people looked to address in their communities?

Personas - structural authority and personal authority

“how can we empower our everyday community citizens to call out behaviour?”
— There is a difference giving feedback in a “public setting” and pulling someone aside
— Giving feedback privately means those that witnessed the behaviour didn’t witness the consequence
— but can ask the purportrator to speak out publicly

Non-violent communication — lots of support for this - see book

“Leading by example”

Even if someone’s intent is good, the impact can be bad

“Everybody is a moderator”
— you should feel empowered to say something is wrong

Talk of the Leadership Training offered to targeted people (2/3rds “not White Dodds from NA”) at DrupalCon Nashville to develop leaders of the future

Documentation
— concise docs of a process assists those who are “time-constrained” - often those currently under-represented. Hit the ground running.
— research backed
— tool of empowerment
— “so many conflicts revolve around docs!”
— for some people, reading isn’t effective. Think of other media, too

”We tend to over value technical meritocracy”

”we tend to mentor those that are like us”

Institutional Knowledge
— is another method by which people are chosen as “like me”
— example of someone in the engineering team being only person who could reset a 2 factor key. Leads to trust in tha person...

“The discussion about trust has shifted to documentation” :-D

“Being open and curious of different lived experiences leads to trust”

Acknowledging as a leader when you made a mistake

Mistakes
— asking for feedback and then not doing anything with it

Sometimes, we need to actively go get people fro under-represented groups

“Been talking about this for 10 years; nothing’s changed”

”Have the courage to do the right thing”


“It’s not that an under-represented person ‘needs more’; it’s that a majority person is probably already getting it...”

Clear documentation empowers
