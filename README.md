```

## How to contribute

- Submit a [Pull Request](https://github.com/CLSummit/CLS2018/pulls) with your content from CLS or a link to the content. If there is not a folder for your session or presentation, create a folder and put the content in the folder. If there is already a folder, put the content in the existing folder.

Folder name format: Day, Session, Group e.g. D1_S1_G1 (Day 1, Session 1, Group 1).

You can call your file whatever your want. I am using my last name for my files e.g. `light.md`. You can also put the name of the session at the top of your notes file to make the topic known.

- If you can't submit a Pull Request for any reason, create an [Issue](https://github.com/CLSummit/CLS2018/issues) with your content from CLS or a link to the content.
