## Community Organizing 
* [`Saul Alinsky`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saul_Alinsky)
* Community organizing as it's done now has been done for about 75 years
* It's quite a bit different from how it was envisioned in Alinsky's era
* There are strict techniques when doing organizing now
* Alinsky's books address neighbhorhood issues - i.e., keeping a school open
    * Very face to face
* Overlap between OSS and community organizing
    (Map these things mentally)
    * Power analysis
        * Getting effective action
        * Super connectors - people that connect to other people, they can form the connections - identify these right away
        * In many organizations you go straight to the leader and have that person go to the pulpit
        * You would go to the 'super connector' that is the person that drives fund raising
        * In OS - a Google would be a super connector, in a local community it might be a local church
        * A common cause and an ideal help unite people
    * Long term committments among people, not just short things
        * 'Okay, the feature shipped - we're done here!'
        * You are building relationships more than a cause
        * If you know your membership, you should do a survey to reevaluate to sample that you are still aligned
        * Transient nature of digital communities (click unsubscribe and you are gone) makes it hard to keep people engaged
            * Have strong connections between people horizontally
            * Definitely think about implementing a hierarchical structure
        * Assigning roles and jobs allows people to feel more engaged
    * How to choose what you are going to do, what are your criteria
    * What works?
        * If you start 5 projects a year, but only 2 succeed - then your community will fall apart
        * Poll your membership to find out what matters to them. What makes them come out in the evening? Write a letter to the congressman?
        * Something that is winnable and actionable. 
        * Like a SMART goal (Specific Measurable Actionable Realistic and Timely)
        * The community is the product too - and they become more invested
        * Keep focused activity, 
        * We and us verbiage - everyone feels like they are included in the process
        * Seek consensus - but not unanimity
    * Defining the problem is the connectors and organizers, defining the solution is the group
    * Show people that they've milestones
        * 'Hey, we hit 15% membership from contributors from an underrepresented background! Let's keep going!'
    * Personalizing the target of the action - surveys, sampling the userbase and target your goal to that sample
