# Opening Thoughts
- People always say of the dead, “Rest in peace.” But what about the living?!
- A busy executive went to the mountain to speak with the guru. 

   He said to her, “I’m so stressed out! What should I do?” 

   She said, “You should meditate for 20 minutes a day.” 

   He was shocked. “I don’t have time for that!” 

   “Oh,” she said. “In that case, you should meditate for an hour each day.” 
   - At the times in our lives that the self care is most important is when you’re least willing to take the time to do it. Doesn’t have to be an hour, but you do need to give yourself care.” Put on your mask first.

# Why Perform Self-Care?
- How do we focus on being healthy? How do we sustain our bodies, brains, and minds in tech? You have the constraint of working in an industry that doesn’t always see the human side.
- Crisis can happen to anyone at any moment – death, sickness, etc can create crisis for people.

# Personal Self-Care

## Day-to-Day
Think of self-care in terms of a hierarchy of needs: physical, mental spiritual. Use this hierarchy to build up a strong foundation.

### Physical Self-Care
- Use apps to help make sure that you’re doing what you need to do – enough water, the right kind of food, sleep, exercise, etc.
- More and more research shows that sleep is foundational to overall health.
   - Set up a nightly routine to ease you into sleep each night.
   - Avoid digital devices in bedroom. The bedroom is for two things, both starting with "S." One is "sleep;" the other is not "social media." :)
   - Be careful of blue light from devices, as it can harm your circadian rhythm.

### Mental Self-Care
- The human mind is optimized for a cycle of engagement and relaxation; pace yourself!
- Perform a wellness inventory for aspects of your life.
   - Identify what is and isn’t in your control.
   - When you find things you can control, give yourself permission to take control.
- Make space for yourself and develop a mindset that you’re not going to fail if you don’t bring home more work.
- Connect with nature – find what works for you and give yourself permission to do it.
   - Use it as mindfulness – 5 minutes of just thinking about nature; pause and look.
- Work on therapy, vulnerability, and developing the comfort to talk about mental health; it’s valuable to build transparency and communication.
- Take 5 minutes a day to write in gratitude journal.
   - Focus on intrinsic things and things about your community at large in addition to yourself: what you learned, promotions/recognition (even for colleagues), etc.

### Social Self-Care
- Research shows that social connection is a big factor in longevity.
- Cultivate non-keyboard activities and activities with friends.
- Even low-touch social activities like emailing friends can be enormously impactful.

## Getting Strategic
- When picking a job, try to keep in mind things that make it easier for you; e.g., closer workplace to cut down commute time so you have more time with friends and family.
- It takes 21 days to form a habit – take baby steps to get there.
- Don’t be afraid to ask for help! 
- In tech, we’re pressured to think we have all the solutions all the time. Remember that it’s okay to not know.
- Create a routine now with friends/accountability partners that sustains you. When you have a down period, the momentum of the routine will help drive you forward/help friends pull you forward.
- During hectic times when you can’t slow down: eat good food, get the best sleep you can. Afterwards, let yourself “hibernate” a bit (TV time counts)! 
- Connect with coworkers outside the office – lunches, walks, etc.
- When working from home, take care to take your breaks and lunches! 

# Self-Care Advocacy at the Corporate/Management Level

## Problems with Self-Care in Tech
- In tech, working long hours is a badge of honor, whereas “self-care” is literally two four-letter words.
- People think that taking time for self-care will make you less productive, when the opposite is true.

## Implementing Self-Care at the Org Level
- At the organizational level, encourage people to set boundaries at work and empower them to say no when they need to.
- Make self-care tools accessible: courses, meditation, exercise, naps, etc.
- Provide apps to help employees track sleep, movements, etc.
- Meet people where they are – encouraging everyone to meditate for an hour is all well and good, but building a culture of self-care is about realistic baby steps in the right direction.
- Create a culture where your community asks you how you’re doing and encourages you to do what you need for yourself.
   - The culture and the community need a set of shared norms. These norms build slowly but break quickly.
   - Align all the feedback loops pushing together so that they drive in the same direction.
- Model good self-care.
   - If your boss texts you on evenings/weekends and expects you to be on 24/7, you’ll burn out trying to meet that unspoken expectation.
   - If your boss puts clear boundaries around their own personal life, personal time, breaks, and so on, employees are galvanized to do the same.
   - Google’s VP of People Development took 6 months to care for her family and organization supported her.
   - Practice good self-care for yourself, and encourage/expect good self-care from your reports.
- Mandatory courses might not make sense, but if a self-care course is good, people will pass it around. 
- Walking one-on-ones encourages a touch base while also getting exercise, contact with natures, and informal interactions between managers and reports.
