Meetup.com is the central coordinatiing point. Someone is developing an open source project that does what Meetup does.

Idea for this session grew out of Write the Docs, now 37 meetups in 12 time zones.

Most meetups are face-to-face because you want to build interaction and community.

How do you find people to start a meetup? What makes a great meetup?

Ask for meetups as a GitHub issue. One organization created a forum for potential meetup organizers.

Meetup can be great for decentralizing. But some organizations try to maintain control, essentially saying they own the meetups. Others encourae individuals to start new meetups on their own. But don't have the independent meetups call themselves official. Empowerment within guidelines that help them do the job effectively.

Speaker directory that people can add themselves to. Specify their expertise, offer to mentor less experienced speakers.

Remote speakers are OK, may be easier on the budget.

Cross-polinization: your speaker can be on a related topic that's not directly your core topic.

Encourage small communities too, even if it's just around a coffee table.

Basic tasks: find a good location, some people require food, get good speakers, advertise to your community well. Many meetups are in a competitive environment. But most meetups start very small and can be informal at the beginning.

Meetup Pro is training organizers.
