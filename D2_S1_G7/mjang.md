Responsible for awarding money for OSS: $40 mil, 6 years ago  

Average grant = $5k  

Takeaway: How to ask for people's time / money  
* Make it as easy as possible  
* Check your ego (it's uncomfortable)  
* Grantors hate hurting poeple's feelings  
** Put yourself in shoes --  
** make sure people who are giving money / time fit with your values  
** Better result -- people who don't fit may be angry later  

* Think strategically  
** Example: swag with tins of redhots, got good price, with a semi truck...  
** Swag costs 3 ways: swag, shipping, storage  

** w/r/t asking for time  
** newbies are an investment of time, may not be worth it for your project
