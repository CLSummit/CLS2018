Responsible for awarding money for OSS: $40 mil, 6 years ago  

Average grant = $5k  

Takeaway: How to ask for people's time / money  
* Make it as easy as possible  
* Check your ego (it's uncomfortable)  
* Grantors hate hurting poeple's feelings  
** Put yourself in shoes --  
** make sure people who are giving money / time fit with your values  
** Better result -- people who don't fit may be angry later  

* Think strategically  
** Example: swag with tins of redhots, got good price, with a semi truck...  
** Swag costs 3 ways: swag, shipping, storage  

** w/r/t asking for time  
** newbies are an investment of time, may not be worth it for your project  

Money is easier than headcount
* Need internal advocate, who works on core tech of target company
* Need well-defined requirements, statement of work (what, timeframe, project management)
** Need to believe in statement of work, dependencies
** Extra challenge of X national boundaries

Past successful proposals:

Moss Foundation
Core Infrastructure Initiative

OSS foundations publish their lists, "4999 form?"

"If nobody's asking for it, that's a tough sell"

Stormy Daniels: "It's better to ask big", hear "no", then ask for something simpler

Know where to ask in bigger companies, 

e.g. Google has different groups for diversity, staffing, education, etc. 

Have a "one pager" ready
* Ready to pass along to decision maker
* beginning of a conversation
* Who, what, when, where
* Timeframe (last min is no go)

Good time to ask, before end of a fiscal cycle

PayPal not good enough, as higher value contributions require banking info that donor's can't handle

Small scale: 

* Ask everyone. Even pizza parlors may offer food/space for the opportunity
* Pass the hat
* Ask people to bring bits, picnic style
* Get idea of sponsorship abilities, based on working level, (may vary, manager, etc.)
