Open Org - utilize open source principles to create innovative and inclusive workspace.  Original thought by Jim Whitehurst, CEO, Red Hat.

Open Org Ambassadors program: https://opensource.com/open-organization/resources/ambassadors-program

Discussion Focus: How did you change your orgs/teams with these open source principles?  How did you break down the corporate barriers to launch an open source practice or program?

Organizations have silos, with or without open source program initiatives.  85 slack instances, hipchat, and other such proliferation of tools.  Create a community of admin volunteers to break these silos (enable single sign-on, standardize tools, etc.) across engineering, QA, sales, marketing, senior management, etc.

Philosophy of open organizations: devops is not a tool; it is a culture of automation and measurement of things that matter.  DevOps and Open Source have a lot in common, except that devops happens internally in an org and open source happens in a community.  Both of these groups can learn a lot from each other and must interact.

Actionable practices/suggestions:
Ensure teams/developers earn their status based on how they fulfill their responsibilities.  Revoke status from those that don’t deliver.  This creates silos of its own, but does help scale well.  This helps share knowledge across teams, share best practices, help developers keep documentation updated.
When you open up the discussions and ideas to the entire company/team, you get great perspectives from different teams on how to do things better.  This also helps breed a relationship of trust and a sense of ownership during an outage.  It comes with challenges (overload of slack notifications, for example) but a common slack, say, enables transparency and helps reduce redundancies when teams share their OKRs or quarterly goals on these open channels.
Roadmap on trello (with ambiguous enough timeline -- very soon, soon, later).  Community gets to vote on roadmap → useful signal for product teams to get a sense of direction for product.  This increases community engagement.  
Send weekly notes from standups to community mailing list on monday.  Reconcile on friday about things that got done, that didn’t get done, and things that got done that weren’t on the list originally, blockers, etc.

Efforts to launch an inner source program in a highly regulated company where transparency even within the organization is taboo.  How do you solve for this?
The core issue is about conflicting employee goals.  One way to break this barrier is to make it part of HR process to benefit both employees.
Reformulate job description on job percentages, satisfying business values.

Most of these barriers also reflect the company/community’s culture.  Lack of transparency on such aspects also results in a bigger issue of repetitive incidents.

Organizations also need to shift their culture from “pointing fingers” to “blameless analysis” on incidents.

“Professional development” -- create budget (time and money) for this for your teams so that pairing/collaborating with teams results in education and helps your team in the long term.

Every project, endeavor, etc. can belong in any org, but assign a specific owner so that the work gets done.

Sharing engineering efforts across the company in these channels also gets more volunteers from teams you probably didn’t expect.

Spreading budget across teams for a shared task also helps justify collaboration.

Hackathons (internal) are a great way to come together as a company to deliver on something valuable.  Aside: sales teams will also appreciate that you (engineers) can crank out something valuable in such a short time.  Internal and external hackathons can also crossover to bring more collaboration across the community.

Breaking down barriers also stems from the company’s culture -- you can only change so much.  So first try working on breaking those culture-related barriers and then focus on expanding these initiatives.
