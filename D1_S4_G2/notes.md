* Stefano's career path
    * Started as community manager many years ago, before it was a thing
    * Set up LUG in Milan. Hackers advocating for hackers.
    * Worked FSF Europe
    * Set up Open Source initiatives in Europe
    * Missing pieces of info, so got MBA to understand the businesses & contribute to the bottom line of company & became more effective
        * Understand bottom line & how to satisfy
        * Community managers have a hard time to put a # on their business value
    * Met this great VP of Marketing & thought of role as Marketing
    * Moved to dev team, then became HR-type by onboarding new devs 
    * Now in Marketing Director role

* Looking at research in the area
    * How are communities valued
    * Community manger position search varies wildly
    * What to tell community manager you're hiring what their career path is
    * Community round table report 2018
        * community managers provide cross-functional benefit
        * under-funded b/c don't know how to explain their business value
        * better promotions for business development, marketing, etc
        * burn out quickly

* Comcast didn't have Community Manager in HR back-end
    * Comcast didn't know how to measure her performance against the Engineering Standards
    * An insightful manager changed her role to Program Manager & performance is measured along that criteria
    * Found colleagues didn't understand the position: Telling people that compliance is the problem that's being solved, it helps people understand
    * US East Coast: It's not as common of a role as it is in the global or silicon valley companies
        * Similarly in Europe

* It's a worry if a community manager gets laid off, how to describe what they did & find the right next job?
    * You must have extreme amount of lateral leadership/influence & find a company that values that
    * PMP certification
        * One way to legitimize the skills you have
        * Big chunk on communication & understanding politics
    * Detaching the role from the community -> Makes it easier to go into Marketing dept
    * Instead of telling people your title, you tell them what problem you're solving
    * Preparing for the question of not directly managing people: Be able to discuss the results you achieved: tangible successes & how you made that happen
        * e.g. launched/ran program X, primary author on paper Y
    * Try to insist on a place in the org chart so that you can know your KPIs


* Red Hat: 
    * Title is Community architect
    * Technical Program Management track in the back end
    * Aligns pretty well.  Have levels against the various responsibilities & updated the descriptions & tried to make the salary match HR data for similar work

* Google
    * Technical Program Management
    * Another conception is consumer products support role
    * Another world is developer ecosystem & they are considered program managers

    * What are the behaviours for each level
    * How wide is your influence

* Critical skill sets
    * Lateral leadership
    * There are no hard metrics like lines of code. You make it more measurable through messaging & communication

* Role can vary widely
    * It took a week of research for even Indeed, with its own salary database, to come up with fair pay offer
    * Red Hat found that technical program manager salaries on Glass Door matched pretty well
        * Beware when defining the titles to make sure it doesn't bucketize them into a track that is much lower salary than what their work is really comparable to

* Salary
    * Don't like it when they ask past salary. Common in USA.
    * Learned from a well-paid sales guy: First fall in love with me, then can ask
