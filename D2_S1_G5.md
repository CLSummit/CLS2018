D2_S1_G5  - "My Friend in China "

Session Leader Background
Tim Pepper (@pythomit) with VmWare - Also actively involved in Kubernetes
He's been doing OSS for 20 years now.  Joined VMWare in part for opportunity to work on Kubernetes and also to help company transition to becoming more comfortable working with OSS.

Tim will be attending KubeCon in Shanghai this year.  Interested in understanding problems working with China.

Summary of key findings from previous day's "My Friend in Armenia" session (D1_S3_G6):
-Sub-networks of people working on Drupal project as a result of language, timezones, and other differences within contributor community
-Different timezones are barrier to conversations (need asynchronous methods of communications)
-Language is a barrier (helpful to have localized/translated documentation)

Technical Barriers to Working with China-based Participants
Technical barriers to working with Chinese contributors because of Chinese firewall issues.  Google products and services, for example, 
are not easily accessible in China.   Tudou and YouKu should be used for videos since YouTube not accessible in China.  Government's 
stance on GitHub not clear.  Have been known to shit the site down but the shit-down is typically temporary.  
IRC and Slack also used though IRC is blocked at some universities.

VPN has long been used by people in China to get around the firewall.  There has been crackdown on commercial VPN services. Office parks may have installed private VPN.  Best way to use VPN is to set up VPN internally and not expose it publicly.  Problem with this approach is that it flies against OSS norms in that it's not transparent.

Are there any ways to bridge WeChat and things like Slack?  No one was aware of any approaches for doing so.

Communicating With China-based Participants
Can use WeChat (group chats for both asynchronous and synchronous methods)

Kubernetes uses Zoom for face-to-face meetings.  It initially resulted in some abuse such as disruptions so had to make meetings private.  Sometimes need closed community for OSS communications.  

Chinese participants often willing to work outside of office hours (unlike, for example, French participants) and to use Zoom.  Typically vote for voice calls over text.

Meetings are problematic due to timezones.  Can consider replacing meetings with "Office Hours".  Don't make decisions at meetings..Better to utilize mailing lists and/or forums or other channels for communicating decisions.  Mailing lists may also be better than using IRC so that people who missed the conversation can read through digest for context.

Zenata - Used for translation at Open Stack.  Open Stack used MeetBot for IRC - helps to summarize and group things efficiently

Zulip being considered as alternative to IRC.

China OSS Market Dynamics
Newcomers may not understand definition of open source.

China is at early stage but moving very fast.  Baidu has 2 projects in Apache org.  Apache participants stress to Chinese contributors that they must follow the rules.  Other Chinese companies (e.g. TaoBao, Anli) have also contributed projects to OSS.  Now approx. 10 Chinese OSS projects in Apache Org. total.

Largest volume of engineers coming from Mainland (more business development and sales and marketing from HK and Taiwan). Approx. 10% of engineers in China are women

Most young people in Mainland China feel comfortable using English.

Chinese OSS Projects
DLMC 
Involves several universities.  Want to coach it into being an Apache project.  Communication in project in mostly in WeChat.  Key contributors have been communicating mostly in Chinese on WeChat.  Trying to get contributors to use Apache mxnet.  

VUE.JS
Great example of project using documentation

Other/Misc.
AWS Summit being held in Shenzhen in September.
AWS OSS blogs being translated into Chinese but not much traffic yet.  Can consider promoting using WeChat.  
Most chat clients support roman characters but not necessarily others.
Gender pronouns not well understood by Chinese speakers because there are none in the Chinese language.
