How do you get a culture of doc

Challenge, when you're the sole writer -- requires promotion

OSS -- best when doc is in the code base

Are devs inferior doc writers?

Minimal viable docs, a docs directory in GH, with a template README
* frequently TW writer resources not available
* many devs write well -- with a decent framework

People beyond core maintainers contribute to a well structured docs repo

Only no-no with docs: incorrect info
* Should be useful, not literary

What's a good process for improving useability of docs
* User research (asking people)
* Link in every page that supports opening an issue
** streamlines reporting

"Edit this page in GH" option "Makes you feel empowered"

Google analytics -- but "Docsbydesign.com" addresses issues with
** so many hits: so what? 
** time: are docs confusing, clear?

DX tracking: 
* Start with newer dev, try a HW assignment with the project
* Docs can be measurable
** try with students 
** try with fresh install, follow every step

Support and content reuse
* Start: public reporting of a known bug, with workaround, followed by solution process
* Doc v. KB

Recruitment
* Who is answering questions on mailing lists, etc.

Best practices doc*

Translations
* Open stack have "high quality" -- paid (every commit. "almost real time" per commit)
* Professional community, domain knowledge
* Parallel doc work, not sustainable
Minimal Viable Docs Summary

* Doc in code base
* Website
* wary of Google Analytics esp w/r/t qualty

Some docs should be reviewed every few months -- as software changes
