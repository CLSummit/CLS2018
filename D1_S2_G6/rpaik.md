How To Build A Community without Meetings

Communities represented: Chef, Kubernetes, OpenStack, OpenDaylight, OPNFV, etc.

Useful tools
-Zoom (with meetings recorded)
-Mailing lists/IRC/Slack for asynchronous discussions (written notes are easier to understand for non-native English speakers)
-Discourse as alternative to mailing lists
-Issue tracking tools (e.g. Jira)
-Use tools like Gerrit for asynchronous voting (and avoid requiring people to attend meetings for votes)
-Other voting tools discussed: CIVS, Doodle, Survey Monkey

Instead of having "formal" meetings, consider "office hours" for coaching community members (there should be summaries of office hours with follow-ups)
