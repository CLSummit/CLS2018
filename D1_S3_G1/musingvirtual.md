How do you determine whether a CoC applies on social media or not? What is the scope of CoCs?  

-Jaice from Kubernetes found it useful to call out individual spaces that have their own rules of engagement.  However, there are some acts that transcend spaces.  
-Contributor Covenant  
-Social media policies for employees  
-leaders set the tone for the culture in your community  
-havng a good reporting policy  
-open source and a couple other areas have this kind of problem where people are acting socially and professionally and that makes it much more confusing  
-scope - Kubernetes has told people that based on past behavior they are not participating  
-the term for scope in the military is "integrity" - and you have just one shot at integrity.  

How do you integrate a CoC into culture? How can we be welcoming?  
-CoC at Mozilla lists positive behaviors first  
-Kubernetes uses the phrase "unwelcoming" behavior - being unwelcoming to newcomers affects diversity.  
-being unwelcoming is also a specific example of a behavior that's an overall problem - you have to be able to constructively deal with things that are broken, because everything is broken in OSS all the time.  

How do you crowdsource warning people?  
-Sage prefers to take away the judgement term reported/reporter  
-People in our community champion the code of conduct  
-However, the culture is confused between political speech, hate speech, and free speech, and our CoCs cannot be.  
-Mob justice doesn't work, but loving callouts do.  

How do you scale codes of conduct?  
-Kate has a scale survey at mzl.la/OSCON18  
-Publicly reporting code of conduct issues - disclosure in an aggregate sense - Paris from Kubernetes & Kate from Mozilla are working on this
